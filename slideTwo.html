        <h2>More productive economies enable workers to work less hours</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="font-size-lg">The key indicator for rising incomes and decreasing working hours is productivity growth. To understand working hours the key metric
                is labor productivity: the economic return (ie. money earned) for one hour of work. Higher labor productivity is correlated with fewer working hours, as shown in the chart below. 
                This doesn't necessarily mean that workers in more productive economies work less hours consistently, as shown by the United States of America which has very high productivity
                but workers work many more hours than counterparts with similar productivity.

            <li class="font-size-lg mt-30">On the graph below, mouse over countries to see the total annual hours worked, along with their average productivity ($ earned per hour):
