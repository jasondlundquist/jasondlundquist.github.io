        <h2>Technological Innovation leads to productivity growth and higher income</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10">Technological Innovation â€” defined broadly as physical machines as well as ideas, knowledge, and
            processes, make it possible for a worker to become more productive. An increase in productivity raises incomes, and eventually ruduces working hours.
            A good example of how tech innovation drives productivity growth can be found in agriculture. Innovations machinery automation, crop varieties, fertilizers, and land
            management have enabled farmers to be much more productive. In the United States of America for example, farm production per labor hour increased nearly 16-fold from 1948 - 2011. 
            This increased productivity enables the United States of America to feed the population, while the fraction of people working in agriculture decreases. Along with tech innovations,
            there is evidence that working fewer hours can itself keep productivity higher, making the link between working hours and productivity self-reinforcing.
